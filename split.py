Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes and
the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in modern 
mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1] algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and analysis,[3] respectively. 
There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for their academic discipline. 
 Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason to 
 prove them. These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that are 
 stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of deductive 
 rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in case of 
 abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory under consideration [4]. 
 Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. 
 Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent 
 from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in 
 close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed 
 independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical 
 applications.[5][6] The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had 
 no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks.[7] 
 Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, 
 most notably in Euclid's Elements [8]. Since its beginning, mathematics was primarily divided into geometry and arithmetic
 (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra[a] and infinitesimal
 calculus were introduced as new fields. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific 
 discoveries has led to a correlated increase in the development of both.[9] At the end of the 19th century, 
 the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method,[10] which heralded a
 dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary 
 Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics. 
 Etymology
The word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek máthēma (μάθημα), meaning "that which is learnt",[11] 
"what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word came to have the narrower and more technical
meaning of "mathematical study" even in Classical times.[12] Its adjective is mathēmatikós (μαθηματικός), meaning 
"related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical".[13] In particular, mathēmatikḗ tékhnē (μαθηματικὴ τέχνη; Latin: ars mathematica) meant "the mathematical art".[11] 
 Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which 
 at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first 
 to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384–322 BC)
 this meaning was fully established [14]. 
 In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant "astrology" 
 (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 
 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians
 should beware of mathematici, meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[15] 
 The apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural
 ta mathēmatiká (τὰ μαθηματικά) and means roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English 
 borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from Greek.[16] In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.[17] 
 Areas of mathematics
Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic, regarding the manipulation of numbers,
and geometry, regarding the study of shapes.[18] Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, 
were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics [19]. 
 During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, 
 consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential 
 calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships
 between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas–arithmetic, geometry, algebra, calculus[20]–endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics.[21] The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.[22] 
 At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic
 method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics.[23][10] The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no
 less than sixty-three first-level areas.[24] Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding
 number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have "geometry" in
 their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level
 areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. 
 Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, 
 such as mathematical logic and foundations.[25]
